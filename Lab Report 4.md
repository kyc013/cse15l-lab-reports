# Lab Report 4  
*Kyungwoo Choi*  

For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from above on your own.
For each numbered step starting right after the timer
(so
Log into ieng6
Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account(using the SSH URL)
Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
Edit the code file ListExamples.java to fix the failing test (as a reminder, the error in the code is just that index1 is used instead of index2 in the final loop in merge)
Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
)

, take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.
For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting.
Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

For example, when you run the tests, you might want to use the up arrow or Ctrl-R to access your bash history rather than typing in the full command with classpath, etc.
You might say something like this accompanying the screenshot for running the tests:

    Keys pressed: <up><up><up><up><enter>, <up><up><up><up><enter> The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was 4 up in the search history,
    so I used up arrow to access it.
    Then the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ... command was 4 up in the history,
    so I accessed and ran it in the same way.
