Some of the basic filesystem commands we learned today was **cd**, **ls**, and **cat**.
**cd** is used for changing directory, **ls** is used for listing all the content in the directory, while **cat** prints whichever file the user selects.

When **cd** is commanded without any arugements, then the directory doesn't change.
When **cd** is commanded with a path to a directory, the pwd is changed to the sepcified directory.
When **cd** is commanded with a path to a file,.....

When **ls** is commanded without any arugements, .....
When **ls** is commanded with a path to a directory, the files and folders within the direcotry is listed in a single line.
When **ls** is commanded with a path to a file,....

When **cat** is commanded without any arugements, then the prompt waits for the user to either type a message so that it could be printed or to end the printing stage.
When **cat** is commanded with a path to a directory, there is an error.
When **cat** is commanded with a path to a file, the contents of the specified file is printed in its entirety.



, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

    Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
    Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
    Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

So that’s 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each, include:

    A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
    What the working directory was when the command was run
    A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
    Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.
